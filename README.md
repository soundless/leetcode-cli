A cli tool to enjoy leetcode!

Great thanks to leetcode.com, an really awesome website!

## What can it do?

* A very [**EFFICIENT**](#best-practice) way to fight problems.
* **CACHING** problems locally thus you can easily scan & think it offline.
* Do everything in **CLI**, no one even knows you are doing leetcode :p
* Auto [**GENERATING**](#show) source code template for you.
* Support case [**TEST**](#test) and [**SUBMIT**](#submit) to leetcode.com.
* [**AUTO LOGIN**](#auto-login) among multiple sessions with single leetcode account.

## Prerequisites

node.js (npm included), please follow the installation guide below:

* https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

## Install

From npm repo:

    $ sudo npm install -g leetcode-cli

From source code:

    $ git clone http://github.com/skygragon/leetcode-cli
    $ cd leetcode-cli && npm install && sudo npm install -g .

## Best Practice

	Read help first						$ lc help
	Login with your leetcoe account		$ lc user -l
	Browse all problems					$ lc list
	Select one problem 					$ lc show 1 -g -l cpp
	Coding it!
	Run test(s) and pray				$ lc test ./two-sum.cpp -t '[3,2,4]\n7'
	Submit final solution!				$ lc submit ./two-sum.cpp

## Commands

### help

	list [keyword]     list problems
	show <keyword>     show problem by name or index
	submit <filename>  submit final solution to leetcode
	test <filename>    send solution to leetcode and run test
	user               login/logout with leetcode account
	version            show version info

* `lc help <command>` to see help on sub command.
* `lc <command> --help` also works.

### list

Navigate all the problems. The heading `âœ”` means you have AC-ed the problem.

    $ lc list

      [385] Mini Parser                                                  Medium (26.5%)
    âœ˜ [384] Shuffle an Array                                             Medium (45.7%)
    âœ” [383] Ransom Note                                                  Easy   (44.5%)
    âœ” [382] Linked List Random Node                                      Medium (46.6%)
    ......
    âœ” [  4] Median of Two Sorted Arrays                                  Hard   (19.6%)
    âœ” [  3] Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters               Medium (22.9%)
    âœ” [  2] Add Two Numbers                                              Medium (24.5%)
    âœ” [  1] Two Sum                                                      Easy   (25.6%)

* `-q` to filter by query conditions.
	* `e` = easy, `E` = m + h.
	* `m` = medium, `M` = e + h.
	* `h` = hard, `H` = e + m.
	* `d` = done = AC-ed, `D` = not AC-ed.
	* `l` = locked, `L` = not locked.
* `-s` to show statistic counters.
* `lc list <keyword>` to search by keyword.

*Example*

	$ lc list -q Dml array
	  ðŸ”’ [360] Sort Transformed Array                                       Medium (41.0%)
	  ðŸ”’ [325] Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k                           Medium (40.9%)

### show

Select a problem to fight. With `-g`+`-l`, the code template could be auto generated for you.

    $ lc show 1 -g -l cpp

    [1] Two Sum    	(File: two-sum.cpp)

    https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

    * Easy (25.6%)
    * Total Accepted: 274880
    * Total Submissions: 1074257

    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

    Example:

    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].

    UPDATE (2016/2/13):
    The return format had been changed to zero-based indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.

* `-g` to generate source file.
* `-d` to generate source file with problem description plus word wrapping.
* `-l` to choose programming language. (Depends on which langs are provided on leetcode)
	* c
	* cpp
	* csharp
	* golang
	* java
	* javascript
	* python
	* ruby
	* swift

* Instead of index number, you can use name to select a problem.
	* `lc show "Two Sum"`
	* `lc show two-sum`

### submit

## Tips

### Bash Completion

Copy `.lc-completion.bash` to your home directory, and source it in .bashrc (Linux) or .bash_profile (MacOS).

	$ cp .lc-completion.bash ~
	$ echo "source ~/.lc-completion.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
	$ source ~/.bashrc

	$ lc list --<tab>
	--help     --keyword  --query    --stat

### Colorful Output

* `--color` to enable color.
* `--no-color` to disable it.

Or use configuration setting, see below.

### Configuration

Create a file named `.lcconfig` in your home directory.

*Example*

	{
		"LANG": "java",
		"USE_COLOR": true,
		"AUTO_LOGIN": false
	}

### Auto login

Leetcode.com is restricting one session only in the same time, which means if you have login same account otherwhere, the existing login session will be expired immediately. This will greatly harm your experience since you have to re-login again and again among different sessions.

However leetcode-cli will help some one this.It will try to save you from this trial and re-login transparently without interrupting your current work whenever it notices the session is already expired. To enable this in your config:

	"AUTO_LOGIN": true

**NOTE: if enabled, your PASSWORD will be persisted locally to achieve auto login, so PLEASE be careful to ONLY enable this on your OWN computer for the sake of security!**
